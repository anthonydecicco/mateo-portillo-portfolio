This site was developed for a client. It is a portfolio for their photography. You can vist the site live at www.mateoportillo.com. 

It was developed using NextJS, React, and TailwindCSS. It leverages the power of the \<Image\> component and server-side rendering to deliver the images fast and optimized. This was a fun project.
